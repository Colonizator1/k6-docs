# open

The `open` function opens a file and returns a promise that resolves to a [File](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/javascript-api/k6-experimental/fs/file) instance. This function loads the file into shared memory space accessible by all Virtual Users (VUs). This approach significantly reduces the memory footprint, enabling the handling of large files without overwhelming memory resources.

### Asynchronous Nature

It's important to note that `open` is asynchronous and returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). Due to k6's current limitation with the init context (which doesn't support asynchronous functions directly), you need to use an asynchronous wrapper like this:

{{< code >}}

```javascript
let file;
(async function () {
  file = await open('bonjour.txt');
})();
```

{{< /code >}}

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                          |
| :-------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| path      | string | The path to the file to open. Relative paths are resolved relative to the k6 script. |

## Returns

A promise resolving to a [File](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/javascript-api/k6-experimental/fs/file) instance.

## Example

{{< code >}}

```javascript
import { open } from 'k6/experimental/fs';

// k6 doesn't support async in the init context. We use a top-level async function for `await`.
//
// Each Virtual User gets its own `file` copy.
// So, operations like `seek` or `read` won't impact other VUs.
let file;
(async function () {
  file = await open('bonjour.txt');
})();

export default async function () {
  // About information about the file
  const fileinfo = await file.stat();
  if (fileinfo.name != 'bonjour.txt') {
    throw new Error('Unexpected file name');
  }

  console.log(JSON.stringify(fileinfo));
}
```
